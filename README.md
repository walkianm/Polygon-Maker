# Polygon-Maker

Allows users to draw shapes by placing points and connecting them with lines. Users can then edit those shapes by dragging points around, or by directly specifying the lengths of lines or angles at points. The area and perimeter of any shapes drawn will automatically update.

This project was concieved, designed, and implemented independantly.
